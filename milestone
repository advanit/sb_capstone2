# Spooky Author Identification
## Overview

The project milestone is an opportunity for you to practice your data story skills. You will reach the milestone when you have produced an early draft of the final Capstone Project 2 report.

## Learning Objectives

Write a draft of your Capstone project 1 milestone report with the following included:

* Define the problem
* Identify your client
* Describe your data set, and how you cleaned/wrangled it
* List other potential data sets you could use
* Explain your initial findings
* Share the Capstone Project 2 code and milestone report related to Github repository
* Prior Knowledge Recap

You have proposed a project, collected a data set, wrangled and cleaned up the data, and explored it with descriptive + inferential statistics techniques. You also now have more technical knowledge in machine learning and advanced visualisation. Review all your mini projects while you apply these new skills for your second Capstone project.
